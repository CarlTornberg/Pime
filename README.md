# Pime
## What:
A time-based on-chain vault securing your assets all within your control, even if your private key is stolen.

## Why:
Secures assets owned by a wallet behind the only thing one can buy, time.
Various wallet owners, commonly on social media, are targeted by scams and threats.
Pime acts as a way to demotivate a threat from targeting you, similarly to how your home security system demotivates burglars due to the decreased risk/reward.

## How:
Your funds, regardless of native or tokenized, are stored as an asset owned by Pime.
Only a portion of your funds can be extracted within a certain time-frame, limiting the vault's outflow.
However, to accommodate larger transactions, the transaction has to be booked beforehand, with the ability to be canceled.
